      I'm <span class="text-secondary">Tashif</span>, a full-stack software engineer in NYC.
    </p>
    <p class="font-sans mb-10">
      Coming from nontraditional backgrounds in education and medicine, I began my software journey when I built scripts to automate some of my work.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I taught students math, science, and English to help them in their academic careers.  So <span class="italic">how do I teach computers to help me with my work?</span>  I found coding to be fun, like solving math puzzles.  And I loved the time my scripts were saving me.
    </p>
      I now wanted to pursue the craft professionally, so I enrolled in Fullstack Academy.  
    <p>
      Today, I'm focused on shipping production-ready apps that help people.
